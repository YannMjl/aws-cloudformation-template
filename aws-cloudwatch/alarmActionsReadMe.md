# CloudWatch Alarm Parameters

** The [Request Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html#API_PutMetricAlarm_RequestParameters) section in the Amazon CloudWatch documentation contains the detailed description of each supported AlarmActions.

** [AWS Service Recommended alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Best_Practice_Recommended_Alarms_AWS_Services.html) 
The following sections list the metrics that we recommend that you set best practice alarms for. For each metric, the dimensions, alarm intent, recommended threshold, threshold justification, and the period length and number of datapoints is also displayed.

Some metrics might appear twice in the list. This happens when different alarms are recommended for different combinations of dimensions of that metric.
